# Google Forms based Webapp
#### Hereâ€™s yet an another Interesting project on exploring the power of Appscript combined with G-suite. Though we all use Google forms much these days, only a very few exploit itâ€™s full potential with the help of Appscript. Hereâ€™s my version Google Formâ€™s based web app

### Semester assessment - Data science Web app ðŸ“ˆ
#### About this app ðŸ“–:
- âœ¨ It gets your all 3 semester results and creates a docs file having visualisations of your marks, showing trends in your results.
-  âœ¨ Gives you detailed insights and also a summary that helps you get an overall idea and ideas on improvement (beta)
 
#### How it works ðŸ¤“:
-  Uses google forms as front end to get input and computes the calculations and visualisations in backend and produces a doc file of your assessment which you can download.

- This is just an glimpse of what you can create using Google Forms & Apps script, you can alter this to compute assessment for more than 3 semesters or modify as per the need of your application. Happy coding :)
